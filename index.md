Lab 4, Part 1 was my favorite because I learned how to input mathematical operations in a program. 
I created and defined conversion formulas to change the measurement of volume. 

Lab 5, part 2 was another favorite because it taught me how to buid a blackjack game. One of my favorite card games,
and learned how to turn it into a program using arguments and if statements. 

Lab 7, part 1 was memorable because it showed me how to build a 2 player guessing game. 
teaching me how to set a limit of player inputs while telling the user if they were low or high.
